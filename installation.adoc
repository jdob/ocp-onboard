[[installation]]
== Installation
include::includes/header.adoc[]

While there are a number of ways to
https://install.openshift.com/[install the upstream OpenShift Origin]
releases, it is recommended that partners test their integrations against
an enterprise installation of OpenShift Container Platform. There are multiple
suggested approaches based on the desired deployment.

* <<install-cdk>>
* <<install-oc>>
* <<install-ansible>>

In all cases, developers can access the Red Hat bits via the no-cost
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer Suite subscription, accessed through
http://developers.redhat.com/.

[[install-cdk]]
=== Installation in a VM - CDK

The Container Development Kit (CDK) is a pre-built environment for running and
developing containers using Red Hat OpenShift. It runs as a virtual machine and
supports a number of different virtualization providers and host operating
systems.

There are two pieces that must be downloaded, with both being found at
http://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/download/.

* The Red Hat Container Tools are used in conjunction with
  https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant] to start the pre-built VM images.
  These tools include the necessary vagrant files and plugins for starting a VM
  running either Red Hat OpenShift or upstream Kubernates on its own,
  as well as registering the VM with RHN.
* The virtual machine image appropriate for your preferred hypervisor
  (the currently supported hypervisors include VirtualBox, libvirt,
  and HyperV.

Details on the CDK installation process can be found on the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-container-development-kit/latest/[Red Hat Customer Portal].
Additional information on interacting with the CDK VMs can be found at
the https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/[Vagrant Documentation].

[[install-oc]]
=== Installation in Docker - OpenShift Client

If a VM is not feasible or desired, OpenShift can be run directly inside of
Docker on the host machine. There are two steps required:

* Download the OpenShift client from the
  https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290[Red Hat Customer Portal product page].
  Builds are provided for Linux, macOS, and Windows. The client is a
  single executable named ``oc`` and can be used for both
  setting up the cluster as well as all further command line interaction with
  the running server.
* Run the cluster creation command, specifying the appropriate Red Hat hosted
  image:

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc cluster up --image=registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose
----

Once the oc command finishes, information will be provided on how to access
the server. For example:

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
-- Server Information ...
OpenShift server started.
The server is accessible via web console at:
    https://159.203.119.95:8443

You are logged in as:
    User:     developer
    Password: developer

To login as administrator:
    oc login -u system:admin
----

As expected, running ``docker ps`` shows a number of deployed containers, all
of which service the running installation:

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                                 COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

[[install-ansible]]
=== Using the OpenShift Ansible Installer

A significantly more customized installation can be achieved through the
https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible.git[OpenShift Ansible Installer].
The full instructions on using this method can be found in the
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/install_config/install/advanced_install.html[Advanced Installation]
section of the OpenShift documentation.

==== Example

The OpenShift Ansible Installer trades simplicity for flexibility. With such a
wide array of options, it can be difficult to determine a starting point. The
following example illustrates the steps necessary to install a multi-node
cluster on top of a number of CentOS 7 VMs.

. Install the desired number of virtual machines. Guidelines on the recommended
sizes can be found in the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/install_config/install/prerequisites.html[Prerequisites]
section of the OpenShift documentation.

. Enable the EPEL repository on each VM:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
yum -y install epel-release
----

[NOTE]
====
if you get the following error message "ansible installer cannot find baseurl for repo base/7/x86_64 issue",
it is a DNS issue. Try these commands:
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
ONBOOT=no
dhclient
----
====

. Optional but recommended: Update the newly installed system:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
yum update -y
----

. Clone the ansible installer repository:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
git clone https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible.git
----

. Ensure each VM can resolve the DNS names for all nodes in the cluster.
While this can be achieved through `/etc/hosts`, it will be difficult when
it comes time to create routes to each application. Having access to a
DNS server will make things easier in the long run.

. Ensure the VM running the installer can SSH into each node using key
access. Unless otherwise configured, the installer will attempt to SSH
into each node as `root`.
+
IMPORTANT: If the installer is run on one of the nodes that will be part of
the cluster, it must be able to successfully SSH into itself as well.

. Create an inventory file to drive the installation. The inventory file
will indicate the VMs to include and what role they will serve in the
cluster (e.g. master, application node, etc.). The inventory file also
contains other configuration related to how the cluster will function.
More information on this file can be found in the <<example-inventory>>
section below.

. Run the installation playbook, adjusting the paths as necessary:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
ansible-playbook -i ./inventory.erb openshift-ansible/playbooks/deploy_cluster.yml
----

The installation will run, displaying the typical ansible output. The first
installation will take longer as the nodes are initially prepared.

[NOTE]
====
Download the OpenShift client (cli) and docker. Make sure that the client version that you downloaded
can cluster up v3.6 cluster and above and that the docker version is appropriate for OpenShift.  
====

Once installed, the only user that exists in the system is the `system:admin`
user. The installer adds the necessary token to the `.kubeconfig` file of
the user that performed the install. Running `oc login -u system:admin`
from that user will login to the cluster with cluster admin privileges.

In this example, HTTP authentication is configured as the identity provider.
New users are added to the `/etc/origin/master/htpasswd` file.

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
htpasswd -b /etc/origin/master/htpasswd developer developer
htpasswd -b /etc/origin/master/htpasswd admin admin
----

It is often convenient to have an explicit admin user besides `system:admin`,
allowing password-based logins as an admin. The commands above add a user
named admin, however the admin privileges must be assigned through OpenShift
itself.

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin admin
----

The above snippets grants cluster admin privileges to the user named "admin".

At that point, the cluster can be interacted with through the `oc` client
or the web UI, which can be found at `https://<master_hostname>:8443/console`.

[[example-inventory]]
==== Example Inventory File

Below is an example inventory file that can be used to deploy a multi-node
cluster. Adjustments will be needed based on the specific environment. The
environment being installed in this example is as follows:

* The cluster will be comprised of three nodes: one master and two application
nodes.
* The infrastructure pieces (e.g. Docker registry, configured router, etc)
will be installed on the master node.
* The VMs are configured to use a custom DNS server that can resolve the full
hostname of each node.
* The DNS server will direct all traffic to `*.apps.doblabs.io` to the master node.

<1> The cluster will be installed using container images on each node, as compared to
an RPM-based installation.
<2> The cluster will use HTTP authentication for users. Additional identity
providers can be found in
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/install_config/configuring_authentication.html[the OpenShift documentation].
<3> By default, when creating routes, OpenShift will append this suffix to
all application hostnames. This must resolve to the node running the router
in order to have requests forwarded to the correct container.
<4> Marking the master node as part of the `infrastructure` region will allow
the infrastructure services to be installed on it.
<5> Similarly, etcd is run on the master node as well.
